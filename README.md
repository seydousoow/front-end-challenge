Front end test challenge
=======================
---

This is a small app that shows the most favorited repositories on github within the last 30 days from the current date. The data are collected directly from the Github Search API.

Prerequisites
------------

*No additional library is needed to run this app.*

Libraries
---------

**Date-fns** is used in this project to manage the Date object. It is a modern javascript library that contains a set of functions. It is light (~ 45 KB), fast and helps to solve many problems like mutability and conversion. Date-fns also helps to reduce the size of the bundle because we import only the functions that need instead of importing everything, even the unused functions.

Run the app
-----------

The project have been generated using angular cli version 8.
In order to run this application, please follow the following step:
  - **Clone or download the repository**
  - **Unzip the folder and open in into your editor**
  - **Run `ng serve` into your console, then navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.**

You can build the app by typing **ng build**. The app will the reside into into the a newly created folder named **dist/**. Add the **--prod** flag to the command if you want a production build.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out [the Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
